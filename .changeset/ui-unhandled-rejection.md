Fix unhandled promise rejections from `immediate` async hooks/composables/stores. The internal `execute` rethrows after storing the error, and the immediate path called `void execute()`, so any failed default fetch (e.g. `useContent` with `immediate: true`) produced an unhandled rejection — crashing Node SSR under default settings. The immediate path now swallows the rethrow (the error remains available in state); explicit `execute()`/`refresh()` calls still reject as before.
